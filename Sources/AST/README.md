# AST

AST helps to generate code for SwanKit. AST doesn't directly depend on SwanKit and can be used
separately. The main objective we try to follow in AST development, is to focus on the needs of
SwanKit rather than general requirements.

**Note**: SwanKit and AST are not directly dependent on each other.
